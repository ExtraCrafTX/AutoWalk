# ToggleWalk for minecraft

Makes it so that various keybinds can be toggled instead of being held! The keybinds can be configured through the config file, found in the `config` folder and is called `togglewalk_config.json`.

Requires the [Fabric API](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/fabric).

## Config

The "toggle" is the key that will be toggled upon being pressed and the "untoggle" (optional) is the key that, upon being pressed, will stop the toggled key. If the config file is deleted, a default one will be generated on the next start.

The keybinds can be any of:
* `forward`
* `back`
* `left`
* `right`
* `sneak`
* `jump`
* `sprint`
* `hotbar.1`, `hotbar.2`, etc.
* `chat`
* `attack`
* `use`
* `command`
* `inventory`
* `drop`
* `playerlist`
* `swapHands`
* `togglePerspective`
* `spectatorOutlines`
* `pickItem`
* `fullscreen`
* `smoothCamera`
* `advancements`
* `loadToolbarActivator`
* `saveToolbarActivator`
* `screenshot`
